    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      A handi (Hindi: हांड़ी) is a cooking basin made from copper or clay (pot)
      originating in the Indian subcontinent. It is utilised primarily in
      Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi cooking.
    </p>
    <p>
      This vessel is deep and has a broad mouth, and since there are a wide
      variety of dishes cooked throughout the Indian subcontinent using the
      handi, their names vary too, symbolising its use – such as Chicken Handi,
      Handi Paneer, or Handi Komdi.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <b>Serves 4</b>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ lb boneless chicken breast cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
      <li>½ tsp salt</li>
      <li>¼ tsp pepper</li>
      <li>¼ tsp kashmiri red chili powder</li>
      <li>1 onion diced</li>
      <li>1 green chilli minced</li>
      <li>¾ tsp garlic paste</li>
      <li>¾ tsp ginger paste</li>
      <li>3 tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>
        1.5 tsp kashmiri red chilli powder (sub with ¾ cayenne if unavailable)
      </li>
      <li>¼ cup yoghurt</li>
      <li>¼ cup cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Rub the chicken pieces with the spice mix and set aside</li>
      <li>
        Heat your pan on medium heat and add once the oil shimmers then add in
        your onion and green chili
      </li>
      <li>Saute until the edges of the onion start to change colour</li>
      <li>
        Add the ginger and garlic paste, cook for a minute to get the rawness
        out
      </li>
      <li>Now add in the tomatoes, kashmiri laal mirch, and ½ tsp salt</li>
      <li>
        Cook, covered for a few minutes to hasten the softening of the tomatoes
      </li>
      <li>
        Uncover and cook on medium high heat to take out some of the excess
        moisture, when the masala comes together, it will be one cohesive
        delicious looking paste, then remove it from the pan. Be sure to leave
        some oil behind
      </li>
      <li>
        If your blender can handle high heat liquids then you can puree it right
        away - otherwise wait for the mixture to cool a little. Puree the
        tomatoes with the ¼ cup yoghurt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken pieces to the pan on medium high heat and saute until
        the color changes completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir your pureed mix back into the pan, along with half a cup of water.
        Bring it to a simmer and then let it cook, covered, and on low heat
        until the chicken is tender (20 minutes - more if needed)
      </li>
      <li>Add your cream to the handi and bring it to a gentle simmer.</li>
      <li>
        Adjust consistency to your liking and top with kasuri methi, your garam
        masala, a knob of butter, and taste for seasoning. This is when you can
        add more spice (remaining kashmiri laal mirch), salt, some tomato paste,
        or even a pinch of sugar to balance out the flavours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish with a drizzle of cream and your favorite toppings. Serve with
        hot naan or basmati rice.
      </li>
    </ol>
