    <h1>Karahi</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Chicken karahi (known as gosht karahi when prepared with goat or lamb meat
      instead of chicken), or kadai chicken, is a chicken dish from South Asia.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is noted for its spicy taste and is notable in South Asian Cuisine. The
      dish is prepared in a karahi (a type of wok) and can take between 30 and
      50 minutes to prepare and cook the dish. Ginger, garlic, tomatoes, green
      chilli and coriander are key to the flavor of the dish. What distinguishes
      chicken karahi from other curries from the region is that traditionally,
      it is cooked without onions in the base, and instead uses just tomatoes,
      ginger and garlic. It is usually served with naan, roti or rice. This dish
      is one of the hallmarks of North Indian, Afghan and Pakistani cuisine.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <b>Serves 6</b>
    <ul>
      <li>120 ml (120 ml) oil</li>
      <li>
        1 small chicken, bone in and cut into curry pieces (approx 700-800g or
        1.3-1.7lb)
      </li>
      <li>
        5 medium sized (600 g) tomatoes, very finely diced (do NOT blend or
        purée)
      </li>
      <li>1 bulb garlic, minced approximately 2.5 tbsp</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon ginger, minced</li>
      <li>1-2 teaspoon salt or to taste</li>
      <li>
        2 teaspoon paprika/kashmiri red chilli (essential for a red colour)
      </li>
      <li>1.5 teaspoon crushed black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chilli flakes</li>
      <li>0.5 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
      <li>0.5 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kalonji onion seed, optional</li>
      <li>2 green chillies slit in half lengthwise</li>
      <li>0.5 bunch coriander chopped</li>
      <li>¼ cup (25 g) ginger cut into matchstick pieces</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat up your oil in a karahi dish, wok, cast iron skillet or any pan
        suitable for stir frying, keeping the flame on high for the entire
        duration.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken in. Fry this, stirring constantly until the chicken
        begins to take on a golden colour in some places.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in the minced ginger and garlic. Give this a fry alongside the
        chicken, again stirring constantly and ensuring nothing burns. Continue
        to fry this until the raw smell of the ginger and garlic begins to fade.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add all the chopped tomatoes and spices. Stir in and allow this all to
        cook on high, stirring to ensure nothing catches at the bottom of the
        pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue to cook this for about 20 minutes, over a high heat. The oil
        will separate, the tomatoes will thicken and begin to coat the chicken,
        and you will see holes begin to bubble in the gravy. The chicken should
        be cooked through at this point once the oil rises to the top and you
        see the holes coming through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the coriander and green chillies, stir in, turn the heat down to a
        low flame and allow everything to simmer together for 5 minutes with the
        lid still off.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve with the matchstick-cut ginger and additional coriander/green
        chilli if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
